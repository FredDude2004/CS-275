/* Problem 1: Diagonal Difference [15 Points]
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

123
456
989

The left-to-right diagonal 1 + 5+ 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal 3 + 5+ 9 = 17. Their absolute
difference is |15 â€“ 17| = 2.

You should have a function named diagonalDifference that takes the following parameter: int arr[n][m]: an array of integer

Return    int: the absolute diagonal difference


Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.
Each of the next lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints
Array size m x n must be less than 100 x 100

Output Format
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input

3
11 2  4
4  5  6
10 8 -12

Sample Output
15


Explanation
The primary diagonal is:

11
     5
         -12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

         4
     5
10

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19

Difference: |4 - 19| = 15                                          Note: |x| is the absolute value of
