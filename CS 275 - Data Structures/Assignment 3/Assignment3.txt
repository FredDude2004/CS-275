Design a Hashtable using positive integers [K < 1000] with
hash function = K mod Hashtable[size] without using
built-in Java functions, where K is key. Use a load factor of
0.60 and implement rehashing, where every time the
rehashed table will be twice the size of the previous hash
table. [final table size no larger than 1000 slots].
Please refer to this documentation for definitions of
terms such as load factor.

Use Scanner to get the following user inputs:
1. Initial Hash Tablesize
2. Insert keys one by one
a. Remember the user can insert keys even after
the hash table is rehashed

Output :
1. After each key insertion print the key and its
corresponding value[index], the current hashtable
and the current load factor.
2. Once load factor > 0.60 print the rehashed table and
prompt the user to enter more keys.
3. The final rehashed table will not grow beyond 1000
slots.
